    <h3>Searching for Flights</h3>
    To search for a flight, go to the home page and enter the relevant data.
    If any results are found for flights with available seats (and you are logged in), you can bid or 
    purchase a reservation for a flight.
    
    <h3>Canceling a Reservation</h3>
    To cancel a reservation while logged in, click on your name in the top-right corner and press "Reservation History".
    This will bring up the list of all reservations that you have made.
    
    You can then delete a reservation in the table that appears.
